# cpan can operate with https, but we need IO::SSL::Socket, which
# does not come with Perl.

# When using cpan, use -M to specify the CDN-backed www.cpan.org
# mirror. I've noticed that letting CPAN.pm auto-choose mirrors
# sometimes selects things that the action can't reach.
#
# Also, use the -T option to not test the dependencies. Assume these
# mainline modules are good and save lots of CI minutes.
