 # brian's Perl Module GitHub Workflows

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5904482.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5904482)

My personal [GitHub workflows](https://github.com/features/actions) for testing Perl modules. These files go in _.github/workflows/_ in each repo. Everything is available under the [Artistic 2.0 License](LICENSE).

* [macOS](perl-module-macos.yml)
* [Ubuntu](perl-module-ubuntu.yml)
* [Windows](perl-module-windows.yml)

## Some other demonstrations

I can trigger or ignore workflows or individual jobs. I'm mostly interested in switching on:

* branch name
* commit message

Other things I'll explore:

* skip or trigger based on files

I'm not so interested in inspecting the environment, but that's not anything particularly special. Checking a [context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions) is conceptually the same as checking any other context.

### Paying attention to things

A workflow or a job can run if and only if a condition is true:

* [workflow runs only if a branch matches](branches-macos.yml)
* [job runs only if a branch matches](check-branch.yml)

### Ignoring things

Sometimes I have a problem with one platform or part of the system. I
want to run some workflows for some situations but not others. Instead of queueing all these builds and hoping the one I want runs soon, I just ignore a lot of them:

* [workflow ignores certain branches](.github/workflows/branches-ignore-macos-ubuntu.yml)
* [jobs ignore certain branches](.github/workflows/check-branch.yml)
* [check for flags in the commit message](.github/workflows/check-commit-message.yml)
